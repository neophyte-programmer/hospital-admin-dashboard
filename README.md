# Hospital Admin Dashboard

## Overview
This is a frontend-only hospital admin dashboard that shows the statistics and analytics of the hospital. This idea can be implemented in many areas like for 
an e-commerce company, a school and many more with the right alteration. It can also be connected to a backend and be used for official work. The page also includes a light and 
dark theme functionality.

## Experience
Seeing as I used this a project for a course, I made sure to use as many concepts as possible including CSS variables, tables, psuedo elements, svgs and so on. Along the line,
I learnt new concepts too.
